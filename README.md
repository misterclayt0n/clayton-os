# Simple operating system built in Rust
### First steps
#### Compile 
compile without a target operating system

```zsh
cargo build --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

#### Roadmap
- [x] build a minimal freestanding Rust binary
- [ ] build a minimal freestanding Rust binary into a minimal operating system kernel
